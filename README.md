This repository will contain RPM packages for EL8 systems and the script to build them yourself.

Currently the only package which I did build is OpenSSH version 9.1. The script will point to some external sources and since it does use the source code, it may change over time. For the time being, this is how I managed to build the package myself. The RPM files are also present in the rpms folder for direct use.
